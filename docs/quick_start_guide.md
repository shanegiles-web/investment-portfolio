# Getting Started: Multi-Agent Development with Claude Code
## Step-by-Step Launch Guide

**Status:** Ready to Begin  
**Timeline:** 12 months to completion  
**Current Phase:** Initialization

---

## üöÄ QUICKSTART: First 30 Minutes

### Step 1: Create Project Structure (5 minutes)

Open VS Code terminal and run:

```bash
# Navigate to your project location
cd ~/Projects  # or wherever you work

# Create project directory
mkdir investment-portfolio-app
cd investment-portfolio-app

# Initialize git
git init

# Create basic structure
mkdir -p {backend,frontend,docs,tests,scripts}
mkdir -p .claude_code/{agent_prompts,sessions,reports}

# Create package.json
npm init -y

# Initialize git with first commit
git add .
git commit -m "Initial project structure"
```

### Step 2: Copy Project Documentation (5 minutes)

Copy all your project files to the `docs/` folder:

```bash
# Copy from your project files to docs
cp /path/to/README.md docs/
cp /path/to/investment_app_specification.md docs/
cp /path/to/database_schema.sql docs/
cp /path/to/design_system.md docs/
cp /path/to/architecture_and_migration.md docs/
cp /path/to/quick_start_guide.md docs/
cp /path/to/claude_code_multi_agent_orchestration.md docs/
```

### Step 3: Create Master Orchestration File (10 minutes)

Create `PROJECT_ORCHESTRATION.md` in the root:

```bash
code PROJECT_ORCHESTRATION.md
```

Copy this content:

```markdown
# Investment Portfolio App - Project Orchestration

### Step 5: Launch the Orchestrator Agent (5 minutes)

Now in VS Code:

1. **Open Claude Code in VS Code:**
   - Press `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux)
   - Type "Claude Code: New Session"
   - Press Enter

2. **In the Claude Code chat, paste this:**

```
I am initializing the Orchestrator Agent for the Investment Portfolio Management App.

INITIALIZATION SEQUENCE:

1. Reading my system prompt from .claude_code/agent_prompts/orchestrator.md
2. Reading project documentation from /docs
3. Reading current status from PROJECT_ORCHESTRATION.md
4. Generating initial status report
5. Creating plan for Sprint 0 completion

Please confirm initialization and provide my first status update.

Context: This is Day 1 of a 12-month project to build a comprehensive investment portfolio management application. I am the master coordinator responsible for managing all specialized agents and ensuring successful delivery.
```

## üí° Pro Tips

### Keep the Orchestrator Running
- Open a dedicated VS Code window for the Orchestrator
- Keep the session active throughout the day
- It will maintain context and track progress

### Let It Self-Manage
The Orchestrator will:
- ‚úÖ Update PROJECT_ORCHESTRATION.md automatically
- ‚úÖ Create task assignments for other agents
- ‚úÖ Track progress and metrics
- ‚úÖ Identify and resolve blockers
- ‚úÖ Generate daily reports

### Check In Daily
Each morning, just ask:
```
Good morning Orchestrator. What's the plan for today?
```

Each evening, just ask:
```
Orchestrator, please generate the end-of-day report.
```

### When to Activate New Agents

The Orchestrator will tell you when it's time to activate new agents:

```
ORCHESTRATOR: "Sprint 1 is ready to begin. Please activate the Auth Agent."
```

Then open a new Claude Code session and say:
```
I am the Auth Agent, reporting for duty. 
What is my first assignment from the Orchestrator?
```

## üöÄ You're Ready to Launch!

You now have everything you need. Just:

1. ‚úÖ Run the commands in Step 1-4
2. ‚úÖ Launch the Orchestrator in Step 5
3. ‚úÖ Let it guide you through the rest

The Orchestrator will:
- Create detailed plans
- Assign work to specialized agents
- Track all progress
- Ensure quality
- Keep you updated
- Drive to completion

**Estimated setup time:** 30 minutes  
**Estimated time to first working feature:** 1-2 weeks  
**Estimated time to MVP:** 3 months  
**Estimated time to complete app:** 12 months  

---

## üÜò Quick Troubleshooting

**Q: What if Orchestrator doesn't understand something?**  
A: Point it to the specific document: "Please read /docs/database_schema.sql and explain the accounts table."

**Q: What if I want to change priorities?**  
A: Just tell the Orchestrator: "Let's prioritize feature X over feature Y."

**Q: What if an agent makes a mistake?**  
A: The QA Agent will catch it and report to Orchestrator, who will assign the fix.

**Q: Can I work alongside the agents?**  
A: Yes! The agents will integrate your work. Just commit to git and tell the Orchestrator.

**Q: How do I pause the project?**  
A: Just close the sessions. When you restart, the Orchestrator reads PROJECT_ORCHESTRATION.md and continues.

---

## üéâ Ready to Build!

Your command to start:

```
1. Create the project structure (5 minutes)
2. Copy the docs (5 minutes)  
3. Create PROJECT_ORCHESTRATION.md (10 minutes)
4. Create orchestrator.md prompt (5 minutes)
5. Launch Orchestrator in Claude Code (1 minute)

Total: 26 minutes to launch
```

After that, the Orchestrator takes over and manages the entire build process with specialized agents until completion.

**You provide:** Direction and decisions  
**Orchestrator provides:** Management and coordination  
**Specialized agents provide:** Implementation and quality  

Let's build this! üöÄ
